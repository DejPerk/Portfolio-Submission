# Portfolio-Submission
Submission for my portfolio 
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I chose was project three and I was asked to write a professional, well-documented, and readable code as well as utilize various programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.
What did you do particularly well?
For me personally what I felt that I did well was my time management. I do have an outside tutor who also assists me in the classes and explains certain problems and suggests solutions in order for me to understand.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
At first when I did my code I tend to repeat functions or misplace them and that's a problem I run into more than I like. I need to take my time and slow down, possibly write down what I'm doing on pen and paper and test my code frequently.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
When I start implementing other files into each other I fall short and get confused and frustrated easily. When talking to the tutor I was told that writing down what I've done is a great way to help keep track and if that doesn't work I can type my full code in one file then split them up and make sure to call the files correctly.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using an object oriented approach made it easier to follow, giving me the ability to encapsulate data within my classes and objects. Overall helping in maintaining, debugging and modifying my code.
